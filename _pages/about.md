I am currently an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, pursuing a B.Tech in AI & Data Analytics.  I am broadly interested in Computer Science, Math, AIML, Computer Vision and NLP with a focus on applying these technologies in various domains to solve real-world problems. Much of my past work has related to solving problems in these areas using Python, PyTorch, and C++.

At IIT Madras, I am a member of the Inter-IIT AI Contingent, where I worked on a Natural Language Interface for analyzing satellite imagery, a challenge formulated by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). My specific contribution focused on the architecture and pipeline engineering required to make foundational models work on remote sensing data. I evaluated the landscape of open-source Vision Encoders and VLMs like GeoChat and Kimi to handle granular object details and implemented text-based segmentation using Text4Seg, integrating fallback mechanisms with SAM.

Prior to this, I developed a Clinical Multi-Agent Diagnosis System utilizing RAG and hybrid search agents to analyze patient records. I also engineered an unsupervised industrial anomaly detection model trained on the MVTec-AD dataset, where I implemented knowledge distillation to train a U-Net student to mimic the features of a pre-trained DINO ViT. Additionally, I have worked on benchmarking ML optimization algorithms from scratch and created a data visualization portal for the 2024 Indian Elections.

Beyond my research, I serve as the Coordinator for the IITM Cybersecurity Club, where my team achieved the 1st rank in India for both Google CTF 2025 and GPN CTF 2025. I also maintain a strong interest in competitive problem solving, holding an All India Rank of 111 in JEE Mains and 184 in JEE Advanced. I am a vocalist and guitarist in the IITM Music Contingent, with a deep interest in various genres of music, from both Western and Indian Classical, to modern jazz, rock, pop and fusion music across languages. I am also an active quizzer in the IITM Quiz Contingent, representing IITM in various quiz competitions across the country.
